## Overview

To develop robust models capable of predicting depth maps from Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) images, which are binary in nature. The challenge aims to advance depth estimation techniques in low-light and high-noise environments, where conventional RGB-based methods struggle. Participants will work with synthetic SPAD datasets, tackling the unique noise characteristics and sparse nature of the data.

### Task:
To predict accurate depth maps from SPAD images, which are inherently binary and affected by various challenges such as:

- High Noise Levels

- Varying Lighting Conditions

### Goals:

- Develop models that effectively predict depth maps from binary SPAD images.

- Explore noise-robust techniques for improved depth estimation.
- Contribute to advancing SPAD-based image processing for real-world applications.
