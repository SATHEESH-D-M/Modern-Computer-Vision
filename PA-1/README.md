# Programming Assignment - 1

- The objective of this assignment is to experiment with Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) for image classification.

- PyTorch, an open-source library for deep learning, is used in this assignment.

- Dataset: CIFAR-10 dataset. This dataset contains 60,000 (32 Ã— 32) color images across 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. 

    - The classes include 

        - airplanes, 
        
        - cars, 
        - birds, 
        - cats,
        - deer, 
        - dogs, 
        - frogs, 
        - horses, 
        - ships,
        - trucks.
